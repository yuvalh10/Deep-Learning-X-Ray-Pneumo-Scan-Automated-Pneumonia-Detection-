# Deep-Learning-X-Ray-Pneumo-Scan-Automated-Pneumonia-Detection-

This project presents a solution for deciphering chest x-rays to identify viral or bacterial pneumonia using deep learning methods with over 90 percent accuracy.

The system will "learn and analyze" many thousands of x-rays from a pre-existing database of chest x-rays of healthy and sick people (Training Set).
Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm and Transfer Learning (TL) we will know how to classify new x-rays that the algorithm encounters (Test Set) and determine whether there is pneumonia in the photo.
